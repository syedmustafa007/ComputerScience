* Storage Devices: Hard drives (HDDs) or Solid State Drives (SSDs) for long-term data storage. 
* Motherboard: The main circuit board that connects all the other components. 
* Graphics Card: Handles the processing of visual information for the monitor. 
* Input Devices: Allow users to enter data or commands (e.g., keyboard, mouse, touchscreen).
